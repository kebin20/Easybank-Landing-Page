## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library


### Continued development

I learnt about the importance of keeping margins and padding in check so that everything is line together. Things were made very difficult however due to the nature of absolutely positioned elements as it is hard to make it responsive in different screen sizes. 

In the future, I will fix the sizing and layout issues for tablets.
